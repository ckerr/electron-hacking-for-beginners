          ## Electron Hacking for Beginners
          #### A gentle introduction to becoming productive in a very large codebase

          XXX
          Hi, I'm Charles Kerr. I haven't presented before, so a few sentences about me: I've worked for about a year on Electron for GitHub.

          Before that I worked on Ubuntu Linux for Canonical,

          and before that I wrote most of Transmission BitTorrent

          So I've done open source for awhile now.

          And I came onto Electron because I wanted to continue to work in open source,

          and because I think Electron is good for getting more applications on macOS and Linux,

          and because it was 2017 and it was past time for me to dive into javascript and Node.
        </section>

        <section id="intent">
          <p>Electron's developer community is high-quality...<br/>but small.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>This walkthrough shows how get started on Electron and why it's not as scary as you think.</p>

          <p>And Electron has a small team of very smart developers who've been here lot longer I have -- one thing it doesn't have is a long tail of community pull requests.</p>
          <p>I think there's a misperception that Electron's internals are <i>too</i> big and <i>too</i> scary. This presentation is to push back on that a little and encourage people to dive in. I'll do this in three parts:</p>
          <p><b>fragment</b> The tools. Building electron takes a few tools you've heard of and a few weird ones you haven't, unless you're paid write web browsers.</p>
          <p><b>fragment</b> The code. Yes, the codebase is big. Really big. You just won't believe how mind-bogglingly big it is. But I'll explain why that's OK and why you might understand it better thank you think.</p>
          <p><b>fragment</b> Lastly, putting it into practice. We'll fix a real Electron bug with absolutely zero Electron codebase knowledge required.</p>
          <p>And it should take about FIXME minutes.</p>

          <h2>The Tools</h2>
        </section>

        <section data-markdown data-separator-notes="XXX" id="os-specific-prerequisites">
          ### OS-specific prerequisites

          Instructions at [electronjs.org](https://electronjs.org/docs/development/build-instructions-gn)

          Chances are you've heard of or used these tools.

          * Ex: installing Python 2.7 on macOS with `brew`
          * Ex: installing [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

          XXX
          So I have to say upfront that there are platform-specific tools you need to install.

          I'm going to skip past them because most developers have already used or heard of these and... they're not scary.

          For example if you're attending an Electron meetup, you've probably installed Node.js

          And if you're attending an Electron meetup and have a Mac, and you've probably installed something using homebrew.

          So let's move on to first new thing.
        </section>

        <section data-markdown data-separator-notes="XXX" id="code-what-code">
          #### What code is in Electron?

          Electron is Chromium + Node.js + native OS bits.


          #### Where does it go?

          It's all statically linked.


          ##### We build the whole world?

          Mosly, yes.

          XXX
          When we're building Electron, what do we build?

          So, everything Chromium needs, everything Node needs.

          If you run `ldd electron` on Linux to see what shared libraries, what DLLs, it's using, you get libffmpeg, GTK+ and its dependencies. And that's about it. Like Chromium, for the most part if we need it, we compile it in.

          You don't see dynamically linked skia (the 2d graphics library Chromium uses for rendering)

          You don't see media libraries like libwebm

          You don't see node or libuv or v8.

          It's all compiled together.
          And there's upside to that too,
          such as making sure chromium and node are built with compatible build flags
        </section>

        <section data-markdown data-separator-notes="XXX" id="sloccount-all">
          ### So that's a lot of code?

          ```sh
          ~/electron/electron-gn/src$ sloccount *
          cpp:         20,007,861 (56.57%)
          ansic:        5,624,929 (15.90%)
          javascript:   4,638,763 (13.11%)
          python:       1,720,845  (4.87%)
          Total Physical Source Lines of Code (SLOC)                = 35,370,460
          ```

          **Yes.**
          XXX
          So... yeah. That doesn't come for free.

          By the way, tha tool removes duplicate files from the count.

          So build tools that got copied into different repos,
          boilerplate that got copied into different repos,
          none of that is part of that number.

          Imagine how many repos you have to clone for that.

          Imagine even tracking the dependencies to know what know what repos you have to clone for that.

          Chromium's Code Management Tools

          1. [Depot Tools](https://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/chrome-infra-docs/flat/depot_tools/docs/html/depot_tools.html): scripts that manage interaction with the Chromium source code repository and development process.

          1. GClient _(part of depot tools)_: A meta-checkout tool that manages both subversion and git checkouts. Works on Linux, OS X, and Windows.

          1. [GN](//gn.googlesource.com/gn/+/master/docs/): A meta-build system that generates build files for [Ninja](https://ninja-build.org/).

          XXX
          Fortunately a lot of people work on Chromium, and a lot of them are smart.

          They've already wrestled with this. They wrote their
          own meta-build system called GYP, "generate your projects".

          Then they decided they could do better and wrote a second meta-build
          system to replace it: GN, "generate ninja".
          (Ninja is a build system like `make` but focused on speed.)

          So... we use the same tools: depot-tools (especially gclient) and GN.

          Jeremy Althorp at Slack and John Kleinschmidt at GitHub did some
          heroic work earlier this year migrating us from GYP to GN.

          That was ... that was a journey.

          XXX
          but we survived,

          And yes, GN is better.

          Okay, so you install depot-tools.
          
          This is is easy on macOS and Linux: clone it and add it to your PATH...

          # This will take a while, go get a coffee.
          ```
          XXX
          The important thing here you want to make sure you have a cache enabled.

          I'll show you why in a moment, but the way you enable it is by creating a cache directory and setting the environment variable `GIT_CACHE_PATH` to it.

          Once you have that, you run `gclient config` for first-time setup

          and `gclient sync` any time after that when you want to refresh your files.

          It's like a meta pull + submodule update.

        <section data-markdown data-separator-notes="XXX" data-element-attributes="{_\s*?([^}]+?)}" id="gclient-outcome-time">
          **GClient Cost (Time)**

          First-time run (no cache):

          ```sh
          $ TIME="%e seconds" /usr/bin/time gclient sync \
            --with_branch_heads --with_tags --delete_unversioned_trees
          ...
          1218.00 seconds # 20 minutes, 18 seconds
          ```

          With a populated cache:

          ```sh
          $ TIME="%e seconds" /usr/bin/time gclient sync \
            --with_branch_heads --with_tags --delete_unversioned_trees
          ...
          250.00 seconds # 4 minutes, 10 seconds
          ```

          XXX
          No huge surprise here:

          the first run is quite expensive. That 20 min was with a good internet connection.

          but once you have the cache, resyncing is pretty cheap.

          Most of that four minutes is spent in repo hooks, for example re-applying Electron's Chromium patches.

          And how big is that cache?

          So when I said "imagine how many repos you have to clone" earlier..

          There's your answer:

          16 GB worth.

          But don't act like this is so strange:

          My first exposure to Node was on Electron. This slide is kind of how I felt when I ran `npm install` for the first time...

          Like this npm package here:

          one thousand dependencies.

          And that's just too round a number to be right. Maybe there are more but the people writing the website never thought it would hit four digits and it just tops out.

          (beat)

          What I love about this repo is six people downloaded it this week.

          WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE??

          Whoever you are... [next slide while saying this] maybe you'd enjoy bootstrapping Electron?

          I hoped that would get a laught. I put this slide here because we've got four stats-heavy slides coming up and I wanted to keep it light.

          That 35 million LOC number is not light. That's a scary number.

          That's one of the scariest number I've ever seen in code.

          But that counts Chromium's tests, its dependencies' tests, and a lot of pieces like this `chromecast/` and `chrome_os/` that we don't use.

          (I hope.)

          So here's here's a more realistic, though arbitrary, count of the Chromium modules that Electron touches directly.

          ### Electron's source code
          1. `spec/` is the tests
          1. `script/` is where all the extra tools go, e.g. release notes generator
          1. `lib/` the public-facing Javascript
          1. `atom/` is the C++ -- e.g. the Chromium subclasses, delegates and observers.

          XXX
          In a lot of ways Electron is just another Node app. You know what a `spec/`
          directory does.

          * `lib/` is the javascript. If we can implement a feature in JS, it goes here.
            But much of it is glue between our public API and the C++ backend.

          Atom is the next layer, the C++ code between lib and Chromium.
          Most of it exists to expose pieces of Chromium to Electron app devs.

          For example the largest class in Electron is atom_api_web_contents.
          Let's take at its header file to see what it's about:

          This <i>is</i> the largest class we've got.
          And you understand a lot of the ideas here already.

          To be clear: no, I'm not saying Electron is easy.
          Some of it is, but a lot of it isn't.

          But if you've written Electron apps,

          if you've used `win.loadURL()` or `win.getTitle()`,

          you aleady see the big picture, and that can be your guide
          when you're reading and learning the littler pictures.

          The implementation may be unfamliliar, but `OpenDevTools()` isn't alien. Right?

          <p>As said in the last slide, <b>(fragment)</b> you understand more than you think.</p>
          <p><b>(fragment)</b> When I started contributing to Electron, I'd never touched Node. So for me it was both unfamiliar *and* alien, and I stressed over that a lot.</p>
          <p>The thing to undertand is you've got millions of lines of code -- <b>everyone</b> is lost to some degree.</p>
          <p>When I realized it's OK to be a <i>little</i> lost, that freed me up stress about it less and focus on the issues.</p>
          <p><b>(fragment)</b> As an aside, Chromium has a lot of solid engineering. [read fragment aloud here] The directory named `base/` holds general-use tools, mostly self-contained, so it's not a bad place to start. You'll find Chromium's string manipulation, memory management, callback binding, and so on.</p>

          ## In Practice

          OK we've checked out 16 GB of source code

          We've built 18 thousand files

          and we know what `win.openDevTools()` does

          We're invincible.

          Time to test that theory.

          Here's a real bug:

          So this bug report is simple: on Linux, the `alert()` dialog is showing a No Symbol.

          This should be easy to test.
